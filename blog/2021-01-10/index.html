                notes on aspect ratios
            <p>
                '16:9' was a mistake - idea running through my mind. not sure why i should feel the need to stick to a 16:9 resolution out of what, tradition? standards? drawings can be any shape why cant games. square windows feel more neutral, less like im subsuming myself to cinema
            <p>
                maybe i like games windowed more than fullscreen? they feel more like objects, more gamelike that way and less like cinema fascimile

                notes on game design:
            <p>
                idea: revisit previous older game about swarms/ai stuff. maybe what im thinking of is combining walk mode exploration 3d platformer of sculpture WITH ai and critter ecosystem... reading that manifesto for game design [link here] and while i think a lot of it's a bit overzealous, i like some of the principles, mostly abt the stuff which from what i gathered was a kind of 'make games as autonomous zones you are invited to explore' deal rather that a tightly curated experience that was v literary and linear etc. i like this idea of sort of combining a self running ecosystem (something like, swarms of AI npcs that can combine and split and form new creatures etc all by themselves, which happenes regardless of player input) with the more ''''traditional'''' ambient walking sim stuff + 3d platformer.
            <p>
                go deeper w aesthetics, im not making the stuff i actually want to yet still, go deeper with normal maps etc to create cool shimmery teextures w lines cut into them. go full sigilisation [link].
