                should probably delve more into symbol/eye vibe sect. 'eye' seems like it undersells haha, it's more this combination of symbols, stark patterns like warning signs, implied sentiance, unknown language. something abt the rune like quality of it-- weird ancient implications mapped onto computer creecher.

            <p>notes on dreams</p>

            <p>not sure why have developed a resistance to 'dreams' as art methodology. playing yume nikki etc as teen i was defo obsessed w the idea so maybe i associate it w adolescence in a bad way. maybe also art school beat it out of me, like in a way that's like saying to throw it out cause it's not based in observable research /archive. maybe it seems too obvious to me? maybe it's my aversion to being called surrealist, why do i think thats such a bad thing to be called? does it make my work less 'serious' (?)? i dont think my intention is to be serious. maybe resistance at the specific combo of it + vgames cause: [a] has been done a lot, [b] compounds the inherent surreality of games to overload</p>

            <p>most interesting aspect of the 'cyberpunk trad anime tradition'+ true cybernetic fiction stuff etc is the rlly embodied way they tend to portray the internet, in a way they could only do as it predated a lot of popular usage. stuff like serial experiments lain, existenz etc all feel prescient of some future that never happened. this kind of super bodily interfacing w 'the net'-- the main form internet usage takes in this sort of media is like this full body manuevering around semi abstract realms , not someone just sat at a desk. can understand lain cyberspace as being a hypervisual representation: ppl shown as huge fuck off mouths etc. i crave that squishyness , the need for an extra body of yourself to experience this world in. feels like a lot of false promises fed to you in a way that didnt pan out but pop culture carries on like as if it did or something. cyberpunk became a parody genre long ago imo, maybe thats part of it, everyones brains malfunction when trying to come up w something new in the genre becuase our vision of the future continues to fail over and over.</p>

            <p>one of the worst and most ugly things someone can do is to assume their position of influence. ppl just spreading themselves like a paste over media trying to make claims on shit ppl did 20 years ago that , of course, only they accessed. probably up there w ppl who only care abt making art which makes them money.</p>

            <p>arts purpose is to delineate your space for you to control.</p>
