                want for a 'music practice' in the same way u 'can' do it with fine/visual art etc. maybe u can... idk i feel a definite sense of like earnest exploration of synthesis/sampling/rhythm etc in the same way i do over other art practices, so doesnt feel far off. sound vs visual, seems bit of arbitrary/trad leaning distinction? if conceptual art is ok why not music as art practice-- defo not a unique idea but thats not my intention , to create unique ideas. interested in seeing where things lead /take me, not 'branding' or trying to mold my brain into a designated space left by other people. very tired writing this Lol. hovel state being

                dating things used to feel self agrandising to me, but now feels essential in combating ur feeling/memory being lost forever. little anchors you extrude out of urself to stop it all slipping away... lol
