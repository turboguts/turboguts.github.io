            <p>i dont like to feel like im making anything that is nostalgic (blinds u from the present and such... lol) but i feel strong affinity and almost aggression towards making a kind of earnest type of thing that really does reflect on myself like that. i think a lot of 'nostlagic' works play off an aquired rather than experienced nostalgia (all 'real' all the same), in a way that's like, ppl my age making stuff which is like n64 retro-isms, but i feel more strongly for the psp, psvita, 3ds, wii, 360, so on.</p>

            <p>they have this whole diff visual language i think is a bit untapped-- the kinda like desolate dystopian grey destroyed concrete building , but everything is just hi res textures on cubes and theres not really any sense of 'clutter'; the intense bloom and fov combine into a hi res dreamy haze.</p>

            <p>16:9 ratio pulls you back, further outside into a sort of birds eye view spectator (in film i think it draws you in however). dead periphery</p>
            </p>

            <p>something abt the haziness of early hd game graphics makes them feel powerful to me. the kinda desaturated look, everythings shiny and foggy and blurry and glows. sterile but in a weird way where it's like a very clean but abandoned hospital.</p>

            <p>⊙</p>

            <p>always thought a lot specifically about SMT IMAGINE ONLINE-- the first online game i played. maybe it's current status as a dead innacsesable game fills it with such mystery, a sealed tomb full of runes. it had an intensely hazy, bloom heavy ps2 era vibe about it, like this heavy dream full of guns and demons you summoned from little computers.</p>

            <p>- side note but demon/critter computer remains tantalising. something about the leap in logic u make when experiancing DIGITAL DEMON SUMMON while on your own computer makes it feel real, maybe it is real. real demons and digimon run on real electricty etc etc. tapping my little keys and a creature pops up and greets. relatable experience.</p>
            <p>i feel so much affinity to it as this dystopia diorama that felt deeply melancholic and v much like 'a place' wth shifting and unstable inhabitants. i never made any lasting friends there but i would hang out like a drifter between groups. remembering signing off with promises of meeting again and never following through. the game felt hostile in a way only online games from that gen i feel do , esp to my brain when i was that young. written a few years ago about how one of the main components of games /rpgs in general i like is the feeling of facing down a space you can never 'know' fully, or that feeling of implied grandness/facade cities , all these weird sealed off geometric blocks u take as inhabited spaces. </p>
            <p>⊙</p>
            <p>i am a sculptor at heart still i think, though i think the vgame process is v similar. i think ur just swapping out like material difficulties etc for code, the headspace of it feels the same to me-- games maybe more creating enviroments but i think still it's like a kind of 'object arranging' or currating these little blocks of stuff for someone to walk thru. subject-object relationship</p>
