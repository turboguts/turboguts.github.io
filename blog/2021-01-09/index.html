                notes on music/vgames
            <p>
                becoming more apparent my attachment to videogames is actully much less in their writing than i thought it was. games ive played/playing/thinking about: Ico, digital devil saga 1, rain world, bullet hell games. All of these i feel are quite 'wordless', but not in that simply they dont have a lot of words in them (digital devil saga 1 probably atypical of this group , being a jrpg and having dialogue), but more that the 'primary drive' of them is thru gameplay rather than writing/cinema.
            <p>
                ill start with DDS1 , seeing as it's probably the most fully formed idea i have. i think playing it made me *actually* realise the ideas ive thought abt about gameplay being the artistic component of games i find most alluring, specifically that game is conveyed mostly through these lengthy, quite atmospheric, dungeons and turn based battles, very similar to how Nocturne does it-- which all in all probs a better example so ill combine them. what these games feel like to me are perfect examples of how 'jrpg' gameplay is 'artful' in the same way something like ICO /journey etc is (using those as 'accepted artful gameplay' examples). playing ico immediately before maybe lent me to think this way-- ico to me stands out as a game which uses gameplay primarily to convey it's 'core idea' - that being the hand holding, which isnt conveyed in any way other than through gameplay. digital devil saga/nocturne both convey their central idea through their gameplay, dds1 with it's devour mechanics , nocturne for general vibe + demon talking etc. something about these games gives them a weird ambient melancholic atmosphere that , importantly, doesnt get interrupted or reduced by the presence of combat taking place every few steps. i like this idea of 'ambient jrpg'-- nocturne suits this esp well i feel, the story is quite abstract and the bulk is mostly you exploring these sort of technological/alien/ruin cube hallways. i like the wordless ness of that, in a way that its like the words in the battles dont really read in a 'lyrical' way, they feel more analogous to track titles/album names. these sort of symbols you integrate into your brain as you play-- 'attack' 'bufudyne' 'devour' etc all take a meaning in combination w action + outcome, u gain a fluidity interacting w abstracted language/symbols to the point it disapears almost. they feel 'full gameplay' in the way ICO does. im interested in digging into what the 'meaning' behind this gameplay *is*. i tihnk analysis of them probably gets dismissed as they are 'too full of gameplay' or something lol. actually that's what ive been lookign for all along.
            <p>

                games i want to design:
            <ul>
            <li> - rpg about engaging with symbolic language , ambient rpg
            <li> - bullet hell game about sound and fractal like branching paths
            <li> - 3d platformers about exploring systems for beings larger than you, exploring large beings ,, etc, 3d platformer mechanics normally reserved for 'pure gameplay' games, not walking sim stuff etc, applied to an ambient experience (jump pad, speed boost, hover zone, double jumping etc)... 3d platformer as exploratory way to view sculpture, 3d platformer as glue to contain disparities ina little zone.. it all makes sense as it all becomes 'platform to jump on' etc.
            </ul>
            <p>
                ambient rpg: i feel hylics almost gets the idea but it's rooted in language to the point it loops back around and becomes the main focus again , like the zaniness of it becomes too loud.
            <p>
                rpg where is all just weird abstracted symbols maybe would work? ideally would be like , after experimenting with what works and doesnt, you would get affinity /be able to recall which symbols do and mean what etc. maybe also have these symbols reocurr throughout the game outside of the 'battles' to create this like integrated system of meaning, battles becoming almost like this codex to understanding the world you find urself in. yeah thats it, thats why nocturne is so good etc, that whole like grounding/reverse contextualising through the battle system. reminds me of thor vid where he mentions jrpg battles as being too abstracted from the implied 'real game'-- from this views would line up, but i think maybe thats interesting? how could you reverse engineer that, make a world from out of the battle system or something, like the context of the world is the jrpg battle.

                ideas on worlds /worldbuilding
            <p>
                seems strange to me to discount ideas around ppl my age obsessing over worldbuilding having been brought up on videogames.
            <p>
                beauty as an idea is boring honestly, im interested in creating ways for myself or other ppl  to engage in abstract SYSTEMS-- videogames are the ultimate systems, the ultimate way somebody alters their muscle memory to engage in fiction in that particular way. typing is similar but applied to a more pragmatic thing than playing videogames.
