                writing or doing any sort of work keeping someone 'sane' feels like self mythologising at best lol, maybe even some sort of assumed affinity w a grander narrative of 'great depressionists' , to the point i feel almost guilty feeling that i make art out of necesity. i genuinely do think i would be much more 'unwell' if i made nothing, and i think i act almost entirely on instinct in this way-- i think it's why i never have and probably never will settle on that one perfect medium etc.

                interest in abstraction enviroments. places which feel somewhat tethered to physics but follow own logic/association.

                am i interested in worldbuilding or is it more an interest in creating these object playgrounds? maybe they are both poles, one signalling a desire for coherency or something , the other signalling a desire for 'object-ness' and to have the game feel v much like an object to explore rather than a thing to immerse past?
