                digital 3d fav sculptural medium because lets you construct 'form' without having to confront 'material' (really). even tho '3d digital material ' is a 'material' per se, it is an umbrella /mutable thing .
            <p>
                'living in future'/futiristic ideas often replaced by zeitgeist idea that by closely following already established trends, that you are 'more furtistic'
            <p>
                idea of enviroment that creates itself, coming up in my mind again
            <p>
                fitting this games world is from the sculptures i made with that same mindset-- in that case it was tables that were Work but also where work was made etc, tables that become game worlds in initial scans, years later coming back to me so i can extrapolate on a chance visual collision into a new world entirely.
            <p>
                disatisfied w pure organics and feel need to be more true to initial inspo of table. superstructure hive to wander around. fragment/liquify breaks up sterility in an interesting way. simultaneous preserved /sterile/hospital quality collides with a feeling of collapse or something, but generally only a snapshot or frame not an active occurance. feeling of an Event having happened you have no access to. worker bee in a hive alone working on instinct.
