            <h1>2020 12 17</h1>
            <p>games without framing</p>

            <p>.</p>

            <p>non-anti violence (pacifism in context of vgame is weak) writing, glyphs (different modes of communication. you can convery thru pictograms even if abstract, you still accept a feeling)</p>

            <p>aesthetic glue to chain things into meaning in sequence</p>

            <p> symbolite</p>

            <p>stigmergy</p>

            <p> games that soley focus on gameplay and driving gameplay as the 'art' rather than 'cinema' per se.</p>

            <p> anemonemon</p>

            <p></p>

            <p> immediate thought: i dont want to make games that focus on forming bonds, i want something that is interior and reflective. something solitary, a pocket climate.</p>

            <p>'no cinema' is a good idea-- thinking of games i enjoyed the most this year, stuff like Ocean OI, which have almost as little framing you can get away with and focus on a kind of elegent gameplay that stirs feelings/invokes reflection (on self situation, and also ur relationship to the medium/thought chain of gameplay structures (thinking of every jrpg etc))</p>

            <p>so i want to make games that have 'no cinema' and are solitary.</p>

            <p>music is important part, well maybe more the 'audio visual combination' is important part. the music has to be my music that i want to make. vgame design as vehicle for expression.</p>

            <p>aparrent focus on games from my perspective rather than anyone elses.</p>

            <p>i think i should do my music idea first actually i think thats stronger maybe. not sure yet. keep writing to see what comes out.</p>

            <p>i like the lilith-zone model a lot, i think im perhaps being too precious or finnicky which is losing the spirit. i also dont really have a clear idea for what sort of 'zone' i would even b creating-- i think im acting too much on inconsiderate ideas without the facility to improvise it into something interesting.</p>

            <p> what are games specifically for then? for creating localised pockets/spaces where you are *allowed* to experience something over time, through your own interaction.</p>

            <p>maybe it's cause i feel eclipsed by own ambition still or lack of skill. i want to make things like i was making in 2d but 3d, and with more of my own visuals.</p>

            <p>flatgame -> cubegame? Lol. nonsense</p>

            <p>im not a storyteller and i dont have much interest in becoming one. i like games that are structurally quite flat, where it's more like everything is open to you and it's just a matter of maneuvering towards the right things. for some reason in my head love de lic games feel this way even though they arent really like that. something like chulip feels 'flat' in that it is a concentrated location evenly dispersed w/ things that you gain access to.</p>

            <p>games maybe more suited then in this sense as like a series of vignettes or dioramas that reveal themselves by ur hand. why is that significant?</p>

            <p> im not interested in the cinematic aspect , im not interested in creating cutscenes or some sort of narratival arc i dont think? i like games that are 'object like' , they are aware of themselves but not in a cloying finger wagging way to make themselves look clever but in the same way a sculpture is 'aware of itself' and it's own structures. it feels honest, and i like honesty.</p>

            <p>thats it</p>

            <p>games about taking up another non human form is something v key i think. 3rd person perspective more interesting as it creates a dual perspective (you the camera, you the protagonist in the space)</p>

            <p>photogrammetry is a great method tbh</p>

            <p>i think im less interested in 'creating worlds' than i am sort of collating things into a package that has it's own sense of logic acquired by the overarching 'videogame structure'</p>

            <p>3d sculpture --> 3d platformer via scanning v important idea imo</p>

            <p>the 'activation' is the text, otherwise it is lifeless bee ess</p>

            <p>stitching together scans into like a large game object as level is a good idea also.</p>

            <p></p>

            <p> so that's actually a great idea: arrange my room somewhat unusually with game design in mind, then scan it and use it as a game area</p>

            <p>THEN</p>

            <p>finish or reconfigure a player model as i have been doing, make one which i can duplicate for 'npc'</p>

            <p>or maybe a few,</p>

            <p>then add a dialogue system and music and then done i think?</p>

            <p>thats a solid idea to execuet.</p>

            <p></p>

            <p>for school /arduino thing i need to do i think its best to make some sort of game controller for sure.</p>
