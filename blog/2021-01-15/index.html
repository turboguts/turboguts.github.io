                thinking abt games which add rpg mechanics; castlevania 1 vs castlevania SOTN: rpg mechanics tie a sense of progression to self rather than to the enviroment? it ties 'objectness' to the player in a way that accumulates stuff/stats/levels etc , reaching towards an unseen and probably unnatainable horizon. it promises more than can be experienced, creates a sense of vastness and unknowable ness. maybe, not sure how much this veers into too much 'belief in the system' re: established game mechanics...

                not interested in 'greyscale' /black&white aesthetic, more so i think i want something that has a lot of grey but depicted in a way that shows it as it's own colour rather than implying an unseen colour etc. i think thats why i dont like black and white photography rlly that much , feels too much like a tacky 'filter'-- line drawings dont have to worry about this, so i think 'fully rendering' i can feel safe in depicting greyness without using 'greyscale'//
