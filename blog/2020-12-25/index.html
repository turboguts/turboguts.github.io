            <p>i dont feel cogent enough to make anything else, just these ambivalent spaces full of symbols. i feel like collecting, like im tidying up. i think fear does motivate me, i think i want to control my fears like most people. LBs ideas abt controlling fear thru place/object so ingrained in my mind since obsession as a teen. at first felt performative or something or a feigned belief but now it's so real-- these strange chambers, cells etc. 'games resist entropy'. i dont know if my interest in symbols is occult. i think i have a lot of inherited baggage from pop culture which uses these symbols for sure, is only natural to chew it up and spit it out. symbols or equations. why do they appeal? as far from language i can get while still retaining a kind of close enough resemblence i can squeeeeeze something out still. or maybe is my brain fused to emojis as a social communication. return to pictograms. i think we often communicate in pictograms like that and that it is good and feels good. it makes me feel less human. maybe not feel less human i dont know if thats the right wording, maybe something more like aligning my actions w my brain. full podbrain mode, just arms and eyes at my computer-- it's a comforting thought. maybe it's just non cogent shrieking but silently, i think thats maybe it.

            games appeal most to me as: spaces, collections, chances to be non human, oppertunity to read, to believe in systems. visceral rush at the implied systems and unknowable-ness of games. mystery black boxes projecting runes at you while your muscle memory fires off, hands fused to keyboard/controller/mouse. becoming my own little biocomputer. " game design shit " does earnestly interest me, but i think for now i have a compulsion to just create like zones to affirm myself. i want to add more sounds, games should have cool sound effects. games also good as music sequencers, feel like my early music experiences were mostly thru 'games as albums', they have their own sequencing, u have modicum of control over order of music.

            other notes: been more attentive with documenting myself etc.  digging heels in against the pull of time etc etc u know how it is. juicing my moments for every bit of essence so i dont die unsatisfied. i want to keep on preserving my life this way it seems sensible or vital. huge compulsion to exist, making games essential as way to construct my own spaces to leave behind.

                notes on ico + music shit
            <p>
                ico is a great example of the way games r perfect at representing non human emotion, or maybe emotion in a way thats felt totally thru ur relationship as a simultaneous inhabitor/spectator/interloper of something while not being able to parse much in terms of language. just this weird lonely atmosphere while holding hands , vague  ambiguous calls out to reconnect (v key in terms of sound design, and is a reoccurant feature that consistently appeals to me, these kindof ambiguous slices of implied language u can only eavesdrop on).
            <p>
                music is essential to games or maybe just sound. i want something thats just purely drums and sound effects, no 'notes', melodies only thru like some accidental tune seeping out the samples. game that has the kind of cyclical hypnosis drum beat that just locks you into a rhythm.

            soft curve symbol thin line on grey. grey is like wool being pressed into your eyes. stuff should feel round and squishy and plastic. making a game is like digging a hole in my laptop to throw shit into, 'added depth' lol.

                big drain spiral that sucks me in a packs me tightly into small cube. symboltile (symbol + reptile hhahah)

                why stop with artifice? do not care abt 'virtual worlds' or talking abt 'the simulation', is just bs shit art world types regurgitate. nothing i have ever experienced using computers feels 'simulated' , it all feels real, all the friends and experiences through the computer are real, so are the dragons etc. focusing on it as 'fake' or putting in oposition to the real is a falsity that relies on u buying into the idea that there is a 'real world' versus a non real one-- flimsiest stance on this is one which talks abt digital materiality re: real vs fake materials, ignoring computers, servers, all electronics (even simulated electronics) all run on hardware, physical components , electricty ( how much more primal and from nature can u get) etc. i think u can have 'fakeness' in anything, drawings are 'fake' etc in the same way 'the digital' is, if u account representation as being fakeness. games r not simulated enviroments, they *are* enviroments.
