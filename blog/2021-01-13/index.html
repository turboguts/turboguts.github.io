                all videogames are either:
            <p>
            <ul>
            <li>    a. Collection of Guys
            <li>    b. Evocative Space
            </ul>
            <p>
                good dichotomy to understand poles of desire.
            <p>
            <ul>
            <li>    a. stands for objects, collection, arrangement ( arranging objects on 'table'- videogame space), disparity breached by game container, flippancy? maybe, self awareness of engaging in act of 'making videogame'.
            <li>    b. stands for an almost painful innocence and a (good) total disregard for the trad. art continuum ( making 'pure' fiction probably the most offensive thing you can do in an art school), the need to create a whole enviroment or ecosystem, huge big fantasies, worldbuilding, not arranging but more sequencing, bosch painting, immerse, suspension of disbelief, earnestness.
            </ul>

                i think i like both of these, would be maybe good to try to locate some games which seem to do both? keita takahashi games seem maybe a good start point (katamari, wattam), being v much object-y arrangement diorama games but also engaging in like a 'real' sense of worldbuilding and empathy for a set of characters and situations etc.
